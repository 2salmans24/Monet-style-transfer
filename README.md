# Monet Style Transfer Using CycleGAN

This project implements a CycleGAN to transform photos into Monet-style paintings. It uses unpaired datasets to achieve this transformation.

## Contents
- `Monet_Style_Transfer.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing all the code for training the CycleGAN and generating images.
- `models/`: Contains saved models during training.
- `generated_images/`: Contains generated images.

## Requirements
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- PIL
- tqdm
- torchmetrics

## Running the Notebook
To run the notebook, make sure to install the required packages mentioned above and use Jupyter Notebook.

## Summary
This is an amazing application of GANs to bring art and machine learning together. Future work will focus on further optimizing the model and improving the generated image quality.
